            <h3 class="headline">Here's a time line of Ernest Shackleton's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1874</strong> - born in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland</li>
                <li><strong>1887</strong> - entered Dulwich College</li>
                <li><strong>1890</strong> - joins the merchant navy</li>
                <li><strong>1898</strong> - he is certified as a master mariner, qualifying him to command a British ship anywhere in the world</li>
                <li><strong>1901</strong> - Shackleton is chosen to go on the Antarctic expedition led by British naval officer Robert Falcon Scott on the ship 'Discovery'. Shackleton became seriously ill and had to return home but had gained valuable experience</li>
                <li><strong>1908</strong> - he returns to the Antarctic as the leader of his own expedition, on the ship 'Nimrod'. During the expedition, his team climbed Mount Erebus, made many important scientific discoveries and set a record by coming even closer to the South Pole than before</li>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Shackleton makes his third trip to the Antarctic with the ship 'Endurance', planning to cross Antarctica via the South Pole. 'Endurance' became trapped in the ice, and ten months later sank. Shackleton's crew had already abandoned the ship to live on the floating ice. In April 1916, they set off in three small boats, eventually reaching Elephant Island. Taking five crew members, Shackleton went to find help. In a small boat, the six men spent 16 days crossing 1,300 km of ocean to reach South Georgia and then trekked across the island to a whaling station. The remaining men from the 'Endurance' were rescued in August 1916. Not one member of the expedition died</li>
                <li><strong>1922</strong> - he dies of a heart attack off South Georgia</li>
            </ul>
